### Blacklisted Items
Sometimes the items will appear with a purple block signal above them ![Blacklisted](http://i.imgur.com/4sexoAh.png). That means the item is blacklisted and will not be generated by the game again. So if you do not touch it you can not count on it to conclude your transformation.

Also if you have curse of the blind active on the current floor this feature is disabled. Imagine if you enter a item room with curse of the blind if the tracker turns on the block signal on **God's Flesh** you would know the the blind item was not **Isaac's Heart** and that would be cheating!!


### Tooltip
Too see the name of any item just place the mouse cursor over it.

### Config File
If for any reason you need to access the config file (it holds you settings info) it will probably be on:

__C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\KabalistusTransformationT__

Ps.: The AppData folder is hidden by default, you have to change the Control Panel -> Folder Options / File Explorer Options to see hidden folders and files.

### Antibirth Coop and Jacob Character

For Antibirth coop and the character Jacob the tracker shows the transformation counter for both characters in the format __x/y__ being __x__ for the __P1__ (or Jacob) and __y__ for __P2__ (or Esau).

### Customization
The tracker offers some customizations:
* Show/Hide transformations (Fun Guy and Bob are hidden on the image);
* Antibirth coop transformation mode, the transformation image is only shown if both players have the transformation;
* Change the colors of background, text and block signal;
* Show/Hide the transformation image (Spun items are shown on the image although four seringes were acquired);
* Resize the window to adjust the number of columns/rows.

### I have not a valid certificate
As this software is not signed with a valid certificate, windows probably will show a smart screen filter saying that it protected your pc and this software may harm it. You are very welcome to read the source of this tracker and build it yourself =}.

Otherwise if you trust me just click more info and run it anyway.
