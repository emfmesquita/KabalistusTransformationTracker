# KabalistusTransformationTracker
Tracker for the transformations of The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth (and only Afterbirth for now)

### Blacklisted Items
Sometimes the items will appear with a purple block signal above them. That means the item is blacklisted and will not be generated by the game again. So if you do not touch it you can not count on it to conclude your transformation.

### Config File
If for any reason you need to access the config file (it holds you settings info) it will probably be on:

__C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\KabalistusTransformationT__

Ps.: The AppData folder is hidden by default, you have to change the Control Panel -> Folder Options / File Explorer Options to see hidden folders and files.



### I have not a valid certificate
As this software is not signed with a valid certificate, windows probably will show a smart screen filter saying that it protected your pc and this software may harm it. You are very welcome to read the source of this tracker and build it yourself =}.

Otherwise if you trust me just click more info and run it anyway.
